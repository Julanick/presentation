Many people think that the internet and the world wide web are the same thing. While they are closely linked, they are very different systems.
The internet is a huge network of computers all connected together. The world wide web (‘www’ or ‘web’ for short) is a collection of webpages found on this network of computers. Your web browser uses the internet to access the web.
What is the world wide web and Internet?

The world wide web (‘www’ or ‘web’ for short) is a collection of webpages found on this network of computers. Your web browser uses the internet to access the web.
Who invended the Internet?
How did the web begin?
Sir Tim Berners-Lee
In 1989 the world wide web was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. He was trying to find a new way for scientists to easily share the data from their experiments.
Hypertext and the internet already existed at this point but no one had thought of a way to use the internet to link one document directly to another.
Three main technologies
Tim suggested three main technologies that meant all computers could understand each other (HTML, URL and HTTP). All of these remain in use today.
He also made the world’s first web browser and web server. You can still see pages from the first web server online.
 how the world wide web developed. 
1989
Sir Tim Berners-Lee wrote the original proposal for the world wide web.
He wrote about the technologies needed to make the world wide web work.
His proposal included the three main technologies (HTML, URL and HTTP) that were needed and which remain in use in today.
1991
The first website went live at CERN in Europe.
Sir Tim Berners-Lee created the first-ever website. It was hosted by CERN in Switzerland, the research centre he worked at.

1992
The first web server outside of Europe was set up at Stanford University in the USA.
All the early web servers had been set up in Europe, this was the first in America. There were only 10 known web servers around the world in 1992.

1993
CERN allowed anyone to use the web protocols and code for free.
The technologies that had been developed to make the world wide web became 'open source' so that anyone could use them for free.
People started to create websites for personal and online businesses. The number of known web servers increased to 50 during 1993.
1994
Telecommunications companies started to provide internet access.
Access to the world wide web started to become available in people's homes. The number of web servers increased to 623.
In 1994 the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. The W3C is the organisation that makes sure that the world wide web continues to develop.
How the weB works

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

On this page you can see examples that demonstrate how the web server that hosts the website you are visiting can be anywhere in the world. It is the DNS servers that tell your browser how to find the website.

A user in Barcelona visits  ? sony.jp in Tokyo
A user in New York visits  ? google.com in San Francisco
A user in Stockholm visits  ? qantas.com.au in Sydney
A user in Vancouver visits  ? airindia.in in Bangalore

Can see what happens when a web user in England wants to view the website of the Louvre art gallery in France which is located at www.louvre.fr. Firstly, the browser in Cambridge contacts a DNS server in London. The DNS server then tells the browser the location of the web server hosting the site in Paris.

When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site;  for example: google.com, bbc.co.uk, microsoft.com

Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that computer.

The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.
The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.

How People access the web
Browsers
People access websites using software called a web browser. Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.
In order to view a web page, users might type a web address into their browser, follow a link from another site
Web servers
When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website.
Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who request them.

How weB sites are created
When you are looking at a website, it is most likely that your browser will be receiving HTML and CSS from the web server that hosts the site. The web browser interprets the HTML and CSS code to create the page that you see. 
WHAT IS HTML?
HTML is a markup language for describing web documents (web pages).
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language Each HTML tag describes different document content
A markup language is a set of markup tags
HTML documents are described by HTML tags
Each HTML tag describes different document content

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen or on a web page.
CSS is a style language that defines layout of HTML documents. For example, CSS covers fonts, colours, margins, lines, height, width, background images and many other things.
CSS files can help define font, size, colour, spacing, border and location of HTML information on a web page, and can also be used to create a continuous look throughout multiple pages of a website
